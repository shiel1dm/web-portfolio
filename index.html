        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class='test'>
            <p>
                My name is Daniel M. Shields, and this website is my first step towards chasing my dream career. I have always been a person who is committed to his job,
                I work in a restraunt for four years, then I worked a sales floor for 3 years, and I also worked as a care provider in mental health services for the last ten years.
                In all my years working I am greatful for all the opportunities I had to help others and make an impact on their lives. But now I have a new career in sight, and I'm hoping that is why you're here!
                Pursuing full-stack developement is my gamble on myself, in an attempt to achieve a career that I truly enjoy learning and implementing.
                Coding can be an infuriating and difficult, as I'm sure you're aware. However, the feeling you get when you solve a difficult problem or you finally get your
                project live after all your hard work is second to none for me. Which I believe is what makes me an excellent part of your team; throughout my training
                I've gone through all the highs and lows you might expect while trying to completely change career paths and learn something as difficult as full-stack developement.
                But for each road-block I've faced I kept working and leanring, because I am motivated and driven to make this career my own. If you're interested in learning more about my work history please

            <p>
                But I'm not all 0's and 1's, I'm currently living in the Michigan area and I've been here most of my life. I was born in a small town in Midland, MI and spent most of my life there.
                I graduated in 2009 from Midland High, and pursued my college degree at Delta Community College until I transferred to Michgian State University. My degree took a while to finish,
                but I never gave up on finishing it. I am a huge hockey fan (Let's Go Red Wings!), and I even play in an fall adult league myself. My big interest in computers started from an interest in 
                gaming, which I still enjoy today, and just evolved from building pcs, to basic troubleshooting, and now to advanced concepts as well as developement. I do love to travel and have been all over
                the USA, Canada, and I even went to China with my high-school history class. So my sense of adventure is strong and would be willing to relocate to the right place. If you'd like to learn more about
                me, please check out the links below! (..wip)
